Transfer Ambient WS-2909A weather station data for use by Orbit B-hyve sprinkler timer

The Ambient WS-2909A weather station sends data to Weather Underground. The Orib B-hyve sprinkler timer gets weather data from [Aeris](https://www.aerisweather.com/) via [PWSWeather](https://www.pwsweather.com/). This project describes the steps to facilitate the transer of data from the weather station to PWSWeather.
