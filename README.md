Transfer Ambient WS-2902A weather station data for use by Orbit B-hyve sprinkler timer

The Ambient [WS-2902A](https://www.ambientweather.com/amws2902.html) weather station sends data to Weather Underground. The Orib B-hyve sprinkler timer gets weather data from [Aeris](https://www.aerisweather.com/) via [PWSWeather](https://www.pwsweather.com/). This project describes the steps to facilitate the transer of data from the weather station to PWSWeather.
